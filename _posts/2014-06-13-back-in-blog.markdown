After this year's [RSA Convention](hhttp://associationdatabase.com/aws/RSA/pt/sp/conferences) in San Antonio, I've been realizing that I want to take another shot at blogging. While I've been getting a lot out of my use of [Twitter](http://twitter.com/oncomouse), I'm finding that there is a missing middle ground between the articles and book I'm writing and being quippy on Twitter. So, anyway, I'm relaunching the blog, to that end, with hopefully more focus on these kind of medium ideas: somewhere between liking and a full-fledged article.

Actually, this piece is also going out to see if my [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) recipes are working.
