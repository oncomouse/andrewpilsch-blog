As if on cue after my [last post](../../../05/31/dark-transhumanism/) on dark transhumanism, [Ambrosia](https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/), a blood transfusion brokering service, issued a press release that was reported by a variety of news agencies ([here's an example](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/blood-transfusions-from-teenagers-start-up-charging-8000-apiece.html)).

After the last post, I was thinking about my claim that dark transhumanism is a weaponized version of the stuff I talked about in my book. There is a lot of talk in the politics of nuclear weapons regarding certain countries making "weapons-grade plutonium" or "enriching uranium."

The dystopia is now; being angry in front of people is our Thunderdome; we are all going to die.

He then offered the only six acceptable takes for the Kathy Griffin photo and concluded by saying "choose your weapon for the neverending battle."
